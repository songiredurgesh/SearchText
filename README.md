Search text is the Java utility which will help you find the word which you need from all the text files in the drive which you select.

For eg. you want to search word 'Test123' in the machine. Traditionally you will open all the text files and search them but with this utility, you just enter the alphabet and the drive and you will get the list of files and the line number having the word.


Currently this only supports text files but if requested, I can add word and other document support as well.
